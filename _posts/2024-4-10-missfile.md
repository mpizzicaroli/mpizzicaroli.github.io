Before I start, I want to give a shout to the Charles Schwab Threat Intelligence team and our leadership for giving me the opportunity and time to give this some legs. As the new Unstructured Hunt lead, this was a thrilling find. 

The team and I were discussing [the MonikerLink bug from CheckPoint](https://research.checkpoint.com/2024/the-risks-of-the-monikerlink-bug-in-microsoft-outlook-and-the-big-picture/) and whether or not you could downgrade the attack to WebDAV if SMB was blocked. We did some testing and determined nope, not possible.
